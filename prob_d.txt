For every ith building we need to find the buildings of maximum height in both left and right directions. After this we need to calculate the water stored on top of the building by subtracting the current height with minimum of max heights of the building in left and right directions.

Bonus-
The problem depends on the equation of the function ,we can take small elements and try to refer to them as a building of varied heights. It will take a lot of computations according to the equation given, we need to find the integration and translating it into an equation.
